# Roadmap to Deep Autonomous Driving

> This is a curated list of Deep Learning for Autonomous Driving

> It serves as: 

> 1. *reading roadmap* from outline to detail and focuses on state-of-the-art
> 2. *toolkit collection* and provides links to important datasets, software and researchers in this field

---------------------------------------


### Traditional Trajectory Planning

- Trajectory Planning for Bertha - A Local, Continous Method (Ziegler et al. 2014)
- Optimal Trajectory Generation for Dynamic Street Scenarios in a Frenet Frame (Werling et al. 2010)

### Deep Learning 

- ALVINN, an autonomous land vehicle in a neural network (Pomerleau 1988)



- Off-Road Obstacle Avoidance through End-to-End Learning (LeCun et al. 2005)


- DeepDriving: Learning Affordance for Direct Perception in Autonomous Driving (Chen et al. ICCV2015)


- End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars (Bojarski et al. 2016)
